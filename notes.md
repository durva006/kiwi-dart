- [x] finding factorial of n :  n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3)… 

- [x] check leap year : A year evenly divisible by 100 & 400 is a leap year

- [x] finding n prime numbers : 6n + 1 or 6n – 1 (where n is a natural number)

- [x] check whether string is palindrome : [ Palindrome: a number (such as 16461) that remains the same when its digits are reversed]

- [ ] check whether number is armstrong :  [It's a number that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to a power. For example, if you have a number like 153, it's an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 equals 153.]

- [x] find n fibonacci numbers : download fibonacci package [fibonacci numbers- 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,.....]
